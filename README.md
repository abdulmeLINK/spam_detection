# Spam Detection

This project is a spam detection system that uses machine learning to classify emails as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The emails are sourced from the Enron email dataset.



## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Enron email dataset. It is divided into multiple subfolders, each containing "ham" and "spam" emails.

## Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of accuracy and confusion matrix, as implemented in `train_eval.py`.
